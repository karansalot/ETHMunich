Non-Fungible Token (NFT) minting is the process for creating a special digital asset and putting it on a blockchain. NFTs are cryptographic tokens that serve as proofs of ownership or authenticity for certain digital goods, works of art, collectibles, or other types of digital property. NFTs are distinct and cannot be swapped like-for-like like cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged one-to-one
In the realm of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), lazy minting, commonly referred to as "deferred minting," is a strategy where the creation and completion of an NFT is split into two steps: minting and disclosing.

This is how lazy minting functions:
The related metadata, which includes details about the NFT including its title, description, and author information, is often instantly posted to the blockchain when an NFT is generated in a regular NFT minting procedure. The metadata of the NFT becomes public and available to everyone on the blockchain once it is minted, in other words.
revealing: In the case of lazy minting, not all of the information are revealed during the first minting procedure. Instead, a placeholder or minimum amount of data may be stored on-chain. The remaining metadata, which includes the NFT's actual digital content, is kept off-chain and is kept on the server of the developer or another storage system.
Lazy minting has various benefits, including:
Cost effectiveness: Because not all metadata is initially saved on-chain, there may be a reduction in immediate minting costs as fees are frequently associated with blockchain storage.
Flexibility: Before releasing the NFT to the public, creators have the freedom to update or modify certain elements of its information. This might be helpful if the NFT's designer wishes to modify the NFT's specifics in light of market developments or other factors.
